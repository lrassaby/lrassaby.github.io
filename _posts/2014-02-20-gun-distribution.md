There is almost one gun per person in U.S., so it's no surprise that the U.S. also has the highest incidence of gun
violence in the world. I wanted to create an interactive way of understanding the distribution of guns worldwide.

It's best viewed on desktop rather than mobile, and can be accessed [here][demo].
