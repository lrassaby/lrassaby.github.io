Inspired by [Twitch Plays Pokemon][twitch], Ostracon is a library for real-time voting
over the internet. It used Erlang's lightweight actor model so that each connection could be represented with a single actor.
After a certain time period, a reduce function would take all the values and compute some arbitrary aggregated value
that can be used in application logic.

My team built a couple of examples to demonstrate the library, starting with a pie chart that could resize in a live demo
where each participant could join a vote every second.

We decided to also use the library to build a simple distributed game where players vote to control a professor
in a quest to get grant money.
