At [Phosphorus][phosphorus], my focus was building software to analyze genetic sequencing data. I can't share any of the 
code I developed there, but I can share the process behind something I made: the logo.

Here's where it began. I was trying to convey Phosphorus' place on the periodic table (the atomic number 15), and the 
fact that we were doing genetic tests (hence the DNA double helix).


<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-square.png" description="v1" style="height: 150px;" %}
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-original.png" description="v2" style="height: 150px;" %}
</div>

Since then, the design evolved. The colors became brighter, and the lines connect to only one side.

<div style="text-align: center;">
{% include captioned-image.html url="phosphorus-new.png" description="v3" style="height: 150px;" %}
</div>

It's cool seeing your logo on the [web][phosphorus], but my favorite spot I've seen the logo I made is on a cupcake.
